# Show Me Some Art

There's more fine art on the Internet than ever. But though it's easy to find something you're looking for, it's much harder to find something you never knew you wanted. That's where ShowMeSomeArt comes in.

## Maintainers

This project began in [Uncommon Hacks 2021](https://hacks2021.uncommonhacks.com/), UChicago's annual hackathon. Our team, emmamedeiros, jessmoody, EndlessReform, and Kat-l, architected this app in less than 24 hours and implemented the core search engine. Sadly we didn't have time to implement many of our core goals, including conversational search filtering, search by sentiment, and integration with other museum APIs like The Met. In this fork, I'll try to implement and expand on that initial vision.
