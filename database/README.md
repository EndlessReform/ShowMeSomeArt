# Database

## Scripts

Before executing scripts, in the `database` directory, open the Python virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`.
For now, all scripts must be run in the `scripts` directory or they will not work. I know this is bad and I will fix this, but right now there are bigger concerns.
